# Responsive-Solana-Sales-Bot (UNDER CONSTRUCTION - USE WITH CAUTION)

**Currently testing at (Example):** https://twitter.com/TestSalesBot

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bot allows for **custom tweet text** and **fast response times**. The bot utilizes MagicEden's ```GET/collections/:symbol/activities``` API call, responding to sales in **less than a minute** while allowing for NFT image uploading and metadata access through MagicEden's API. This bot is designed to run on an external server.

**Note: this bot was tested on a [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/) and an internet connection** - ($35 USD and under Approx.). All else was free (Twitter access). Usable on Windows/Unix based servers.

[[Back to contents]](https://github.com/WilliamAmbrozic/Responsive-Solana-NFT-Sales-Bot#contents)

### 1. Add Your NFT MagicEden Collection Symbol to the Config.json

![shot 1](https://imgur.com/OnbyLbV.png)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A collection's symbol can be found by going to https://magiceden.io/ and searching for your collection's marketplace page (click the search bar). Look at the url and copy the text appearing directly after the last dash following "marketplace" as highlighted above. This text is your collection's symbol, this is needed for the bot to know what collection to tweet out. Paste this value in the **./config/config.json** attribute called **ME_symbol** as seen [here](https://github.com/WilliamAmbrozic/Responsive-Solana-NFT-Sales-Bot#Config).

### 2. Add your Twitter Developer Credentials to the Config.json

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. Make a Twitter account and sign up to become a Twitter developer [here](https://developer.twitter.com/).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Make sure your Twitter developer account has elevated access for image uploading [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/products/elevated).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. Make sure that the Access Token and Secret has been created with Read and Write permissions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. Place your Twitter developer credentials in **./config/config.json** as seen [here](https://github.com/WilliamAmbrozic/Responsive-Solana-NFT-Sales-Bot#Config).

## Config

[[Back to contents]](https://github.com/WilliamAmbrozic/Responsive-Solana-NFT-Sales-Bot#contents)

The config file **./config/config.json** will look something like this:
```
{
  "ME_symbol": "ADD_YOUR_SYMBOL_HERE",
  "twitter_credentials": {
    "bearer_token": "ADD_YOURS_HERE",
    "consumer_key": "ADD_YOURS_HERE",
    "consumer_secret": "ADD_YOURS_HERE",
    "access_token": "ADD_YOURS_HERE",
    "access_token_secret": "ADD_YOURS_HERE"
  },
  "tweet_text": "BOOM💥 [-n] just sold for [-p] ([-f])",
  "fiat_currency": "USD",
  "TPS": 2,
  "activities_per_call": 500
}

```

### Optional Attributes
**tweet_text**: You can customize the text that is tweeted out with the NFT image. Tweet text follows this notation (the bot will replace the following syntax with ...):
* [-n]: The NFT name (Ex. SolGod #0001)
* [-f]: The fiat price with respect to the fiat_currency value described below (Ex. $199.19 USD)
* [-p]: The sale price in Solana (Ex. 10 SOL)
* [-o]: The buyers wallet address
* [-m]: The NFT's mint address
* [-i]: The NFT image url (Not needed to display the NFT image)
* [-s]: The source of the sale (Ex. magiceden_v2)
* [-b]: The blockTime the transaction occured at (Ex. 21647306453)

For example, 
```
BOOM💥 [-n] just sold for [-p] ([-f])
```
would become
```
BOOM💥 SolGod #001 just sold for 50.24 SOL ($5000.37 USD)
```

**fiat_currency**: The bot currently supports the following currencies: EUR, USD, CAD, JPY, GPB, AUD, CNY, INR. Change this value to change the currency in which Solana is converted if you choose to output fiat price.
